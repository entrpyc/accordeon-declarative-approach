          Twice a day apply the lotion with a cotton pad on cleansed skin all over the face, avoiding eye contour area. In case of single breakouts apply the lotion 2-3 times a day only on these affected spots.
Moisturizing cream, such as Acnaut Hydro Active Cream, and/or makeup can be applied at least 10-15 minutes after the lotion.

To prevent ingrown hairs — apply the lotion right after the epilation and repeat after a few hours. Follow this routine in next couple of days.
